1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,618
My name is Wade Watts.

1
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:12,971
My dad picked the name because
it sounded like a superhero's alter ego.

1
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:14,910
Like Peter Parker

1
00:00:15,035 --> 00:00:16,335
or Bruce Banner.

1
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:19,101
But he died when I was a kid.
My mom, too.

1
00:00:20,696 --> 00:00:22,466
And I ended up here.

1
00:00:25,097 --> 00:00:27,485
Sitting here my tiny corner
of nowhere.

1
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:30,095
There's nowhere left to go,

1
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:32,028
nowhere,

1
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:35,329
except the OASIS.

1
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:43,980
A whole virtual universe.

1
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:53,594
People come to the OASIS
for all the things they can do. 

1
00:00:57,597 --> 00:00:58,641
But they stay

1
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:01,435
because of all the things
they can be.

1
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:02,895
Can you feel this?

1
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:05,981
Yeah.

1
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:08,818
It's the only place that feels
like I mean anything.

1
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:13,343
The OASIS was the brainchild
of James Halliday.

1
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:16,118
Hello.
If you're watching this, I'm dead.

1
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:20,121
I created a hidden object,
an easter egg.

1
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:22,331
The first person to find the egg

1
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:25,127
will inherit half a trillion dollars

1
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:28,755
and total control
of the OASIS itself.

1
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:35,178
Who is this, Parzival?

1
00:01:35,343 --> 00:01:36,804
And how the hell is he winning?

1
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,015
Find him.

1
00:01:39,472 --> 00:01:40,933
This isn't just a game.

1
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,396
I'm talking about
actual life-and-death stuff.

1
00:01:44,777 --> 00:01:45,647
The OASIS,

1
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:48,024
the world's most important
economic resource.

1
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,903
It's nothing less than a war
for control of the future.

1
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,493
Welcome to the rebellion, Wade.

1
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:11,590
Like many of you people,
I only came here to escape.

1
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,594
But I found something much bigger
than just myself.

1
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:18,930
Are you willing to fight?

1
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:22,600
Help us save the OASIS.
